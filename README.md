# NAND2Tetris Projects

This repository contains my work for the Nand2Tetris course/book "The Elements of Computing Systems" by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken.

The course guides the construction of a computer system from first principles, starting with logic gates and culminating in a working high-level language and operating system.
Project Structure

Each directory corresponds to a project in the course:

    01 – Boolean Logic (basic gates like And, Or, Not, etc.)

    02 – Boolean Arithmetic (e.g., ALU)

    03 – Memory (e.g., Register, RAM)

    ... – Further projects (Hack assembler, VM translator, etc.)

Files are written in Hardware Description Language (HDL) and tested using the online hardware simulator.

## Tools

The official Nand2Tetris software suite is used for simulation and testing. Available at: https://www.nand2tetris.org/software.

I am using the newer web IDE available here:

This repository is for educational and personal learning purposes. All implementations are my own unless otherwise stated.
